# BOYS Expense Tracker - Walkthrough

I have successfully built the high-fidelity **BOYS Expense Tracker** prototype. The visual style follows the "Glassmorphism" trend with a Mint Green and Soft Coral palette, as requested.

## Completed Features
- **Dashboard**: "Today's Spending" card and a CSS-based circular Budget Chart.
- **Glassmorphism UI**: Frosted glass effects on cards and the bottom navigation bar.
- **Transactions List**: Clean list with category icons, timestamps, and amounts.
- **Visual Polish**: Gradient backgrounds, Inter typography, and iOS-style status bar placeholder.
- **Interactive Elements**:
    - **Add Expense Modal**: Floating Action Button (FAB) opens a full-screen glass modal.
    - **Numpad**: Custom styling for numeric input.
    - **View Toggles**: Daily, Monthly, and Yearly filters now work!

## Functional Updates (Final Phase)
The app is now **Production Ready** (Local):
- **Stats View**:
    - Click the **Bar Chart** icon in the bottom menu.
    - Visualize spending with bar charts that compare categories (Food vs Transport, etc.).
- **Persistence**: Refresh the page, and your expenses are still there! (Saved in LocalStorage).
- **Time Filters**: Smart filtering by Day/Month/Year.
- **Smart Grouping & Details**: Grouped categories, drill-down details, edit/delete actions, and remarks.
