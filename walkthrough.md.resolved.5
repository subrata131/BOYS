# BOYS Expense Tracker - Walkthrough

I have successfully built the high-fidelity **BOYS Expense Tracker** prototype. The visual style follows the "Glassmorphism" trend with a Mint Green and Soft Coral palette, as requested.

## Completed Features
- **Dashboard**: "Today's Spending" card and a CSS-based circular Budget Chart.
- **Glassmorphism UI**: Frosted glass effects on cards and the bottom navigation bar.
- **Transactions List**: Clean list with category icons, timestamps, and amounts.
- **Visual Polish**: Gradient backgrounds, Inter typography, and iOS-style status bar placeholder.
- **Interactive Elements**:
    - **Add Expense Modal**: Floating Action Button (FAB) opens a full-screen glass modal.
    - **Numpad**: Custom styling for numeric input.
    - **View Toggles**: Daily, Monthly, and Yearly filters now work!

## Functional Updates (Final Phase)
The app is now **Production Ready** (Local):
- **Persistence**: Refresh the page, and your expenses are still there! (Saved in LocalStorage).
- **Time Filters**:
    - **Daily**: Shows expenses for *today only*.
    - **Monthly**: Shows expenses for *this month*. Budget scales to monthly view.
    - **Yearly**: Shows expenses for *this year*.
- **Smart Grouping & Details**: Grouped categories, drill-down details, edit/delete actions, and remarks.

## How to Test
1.  **Open [index.html](file:///C:/Users/Subrata%20Das/.gemini/antigravity/brain/861e764a-99a8-4932-a16c-0fb431fca6ff/index.html)**: Open the file in Chrome, Safari, or Edge.
2.  **Test Persistence**:
    - Add an expense.
    - **Refresh the page**.
    - Verify the expense is still there.
3.  **Test Filters**:
    - Toggle between **Daily** and **Monthly**.
    - If you added expenses today, they show in both.
    - (Advanced: You can manually edit the date in [app.js](file:///C:/Users/Subrata%20Das/.gemini/antigravity/brain/861e764a-99a8-4932-a16c-0fb431fca6ff/app.js) to test older dates if comfortable with code).
