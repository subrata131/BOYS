# BOYS Expense Tracker - Walkthrough

I have successfully built the high-fidelity **BOYS Expense Tracker** prototype. The visual style follows the "Glassmorphism" trend with a Mint Green and Soft Coral palette, as requested.

## Completed Features
- **Dashboard**: "Today's Spending" card and a CSS-based circular Budget Chart.
- **Glassmorphism UI**: Frosted glass effects on cards and the bottom navigation bar.
- **Transactions List**: Clean list with category icons, timestamps, and amounts.
- **Visual Polish**: Gradient backgrounds, Inter typography, and iOS-style status bar placeholder.
- **Interactive Elements**:
    - **Add Expense Modal**: Floating Action Button (FAB) opens a full-screen glass modal.
    - **Numpad**: Custom styling for numeric input.
    - **View Toggles**: Buttons to switch between Daily, Monthly, and Yearly (Visual state only).

## Functional Updates (All Phases)
The app is now **Fully Interactive**:
- **Smart Grouping**: Expenses are consolidated by category in the main list.
- **Details Drill-Down**: Click any category to see individual transactions with **Remarks**.
- **Edit & Delete**: 
    - Open a category detail view.
    - **Trash Icon**: Deletes a transaction instantly.
    - **Pencil Icon**: Opens the modal with your data pre-filled, so you can change the amount or note.
