# BOYS Expense Tracker - Walkthrough

I have successfully built the high-fidelity **BOYS Expense Tracker** prototype. The visual style follows the "Glassmorphism" trend with a Mint Green and Soft Coral palette, as requested.

## Completed Features
- **Dashboard**: "Today's Spending" card and a CSS-based circular Budget Chart.
- **Glassmorphism UI**: Frosted glass effects on cards and the bottom navigation bar.
- **Transactions List**: Clean list with category icons, timestamps, and amounts.
- **Visual Polish**: Gradient backgrounds, Inter typography, and iOS-style status bar placeholder.
- **Interactive Elements**:
    - **Add Expense Modal**: Floating Action Button (FAB) opens a full-screen glass modal.
    - **Numpad**: Custom styling for numeric input.
    - **View Toggles**: Daily, Monthly, and Yearly filters now work!

## Functional Updates (Final Phase)
The app is now **Production Ready** (Local):
- **Stats View**: Click the **Bar Chart** icon in the navbar.
- **Budget Control**: Click the **Wallet** icon. Set your own daily budget (e.g., ₹500) and watch the dashboard circle serve as a warning.
- **Persistence**: All data (expenses + budget settings) is saved locally.
- **Time Filters**: Smart filtering by Day/Month/Year.
- **Smart Grouping & Details**: Grouped categories, drill-down details, edit/delete actions, and remarks.

## How to Test
1.  **Open [index.html](file:///C:/Users/Subrata%20Das/.gemini/antigravity/brain/861e764a-99a8-4932-a16c-0fb431fca6ff/index.html)**: Open the file in Chrome, Safari, or Edge.
2.  **Test Persistence**:
    - Add an expense.
    - **Refresh the page**.
    - Verify the expense is still there.
3.  **Test Stats**:
    - Click the **second icon** (Bar Chart) in the bottom navigation.
4.  **Test Budget**:
    - Click the **third icon** (Wallet).
    - Change input to `100`. Click **Update**.
    - Go back to Home.
    - If you spent > 80 (80%), the circle should be amber/red!
