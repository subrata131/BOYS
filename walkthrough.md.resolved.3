# BOYS Expense Tracker - Walkthrough

I have successfully built the high-fidelity **BOYS Expense Tracker** prototype. The visual style follows the "Glassmorphism" trend with a Mint Green and Soft Coral palette, as requested.

## Completed Features
- **Dashboard**: "Today's Spending" card and a CSS-based circular Budget Chart.
- **Glassmorphism UI**: Frosted glass effects on cards and the bottom navigation bar.
- **Transactions List**: Clean list with category icons, timestamps, and amounts.
- **Visual Polish**: Gradient backgrounds, Inter typography, and iOS-style status bar placeholder.
- **Interactive Elements**:
    - **Add Expense Modal**: Floating Action Button (FAB) opens a full-screen glass modal.
    - **Numpad**: Custom styling for numeric input.
    - **View Toggles**: Buttons to switch between Daily, Monthly, and Yearly (Visual state only).

## Functional Updates (Phase 4: Details & Remarks)
The app is now **Deeply Interactive**:
- **Consolidated Categories**: Expenses are grouped by category (e.g., "Food").
- **Drill-Down Details**: **Click on any category group** in the list to see a full history of expenses for that category.
- **Remarks**: When adding an expense, you can now add a **custom note** (e.g., "Lunch with Bob"). This note appears in the detail view.
