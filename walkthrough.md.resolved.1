# BOYS Expense Tracker - Walkthrough

I have successfully built the high-fidelity **BOYS Expense Tracker** prototype. The visual style follows the "Glassmorphism" trend with a Mint Green and Soft Coral palette, as requested.

## Completed Features
- **Dashboard**: "Today's Spending" card and a CSS-based circular Budget Chart.
- **Glassmorphism UI**: Frosted glass effects on cards and the bottom navigation bar.
- **Transactions List**: Clean list with category icons, timestamps, and amounts.
- **Visual Polish**: Gradient backgrounds, Inter typography, and iOS-style status bar placeholder.
- **Interactive Elements**:
    - **Add Expense Modal**: Floating Action Button (FAB) opens a full-screen glass modal.
    - **Numpad**: Custom styling for numeric input.
    - **View Toggles**: Buttons to switch between Daily, Monthly, and Yearly (Visual state only).

## Functional Updates (Phase 2)
The app is now **Interactive**:
- **Add Transactions**: Keying in an amount and clicking "Save" adds it to the list immediately.
- **Real-time Calculations**: The "Today's Spending" total updates instantly.
- **Dynamic Budget Tracker**: The circular chart fills up as you spend. If you cross 80% (₹160), it turns amber!

## How to Test
Since this is a client-side prototype, you can run it directly in your browser.

1.  **Open [index.html](file:///C:/Users/Subrata%20Das/.gemini/antigravity/brain/861e764a-99a8-4932-a16c-0fb431fca6ff/index.html)**: Open the file in Chrome, Safari, or Edge.
2.  **Mobile View**: For the best experience, open Developer Tools (F12) and toggle the **Device Toolbar** (Ctrl+Shift+M) to simulate an iPhone 14 Pro or similar device.
3.  **Interactions**:
    - Click the **+** (FAB) button to see the "Add Expense" modal slide up.
    - Type numbers on the keypad to see the amount update.
    - Click **Save Expense** to see the button animation and modal close.
    - Click the bottom navigation icons to see the active state change.
