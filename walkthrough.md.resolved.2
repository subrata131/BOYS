# BOYS Expense Tracker - Walkthrough

I have successfully built the high-fidelity **BOYS Expense Tracker** prototype. The visual style follows the "Glassmorphism" trend with a Mint Green and Soft Coral palette, as requested.

## Completed Features
- **Dashboard**: "Today's Spending" card and a CSS-based circular Budget Chart.
- **Glassmorphism UI**: Frosted glass effects on cards and the bottom navigation bar.
- **Transactions List**: Clean list with category icons, timestamps, and amounts.
- **Visual Polish**: Gradient backgrounds, Inter typography, and iOS-style status bar placeholder.
- **Interactive Elements**:
    - **Add Expense Modal**: Floating Action Button (FAB) opens a full-screen glass modal.
    - **Numpad**: Custom styling for numeric input.
    - **View Toggles**: Buttons to switch between Daily, Monthly, and Yearly (Visual state only).

## Functional Updates (Phase 3: Grouping)
The app is now **Smart & Interactive**:
- **Consolidated Categories**: Expenses are grouped by category. All "Food" spending appears as a single item with a total sum.
- **Add Transactions**: Keying in an amount and clicking "Save" adds it to the category total immediately.
- **Real-time Calculations**: "Today's Spending" updates instantly.
- **Dynamic Budget Tracker**: The circular chart turns amber if you exceed 80% (₹160).
